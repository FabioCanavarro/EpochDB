//! # TransientDB ðŸ¦€
//!
//! An intelligent, persistent, and concurrent key-value store for Rust,
//! designed to manage data with a lifecycle.
//!
//! **TransientDB** is an opinionated database engine built on the robust foundation of `sled`.
//! It's designed specifically for workloads where the relevance of data changes over time,
//! such as caching, session management, and real-time analytics.
//!
//! It provides a high-level, ergonomic API by treating data's **access frequency**
//! and **age** as first-class citizens.

/// This struct holds the connection to the `sled` database and provides
/// safe, high-level access to the various data trees. It manages a background
/// thread for handling TTL (Time-To-Live) expirations automatically.
///
/// When this struct is dropped, it will signal the background thread to shut down
/// and wait for it to finish gracefully.
///
/// The main reason to why it stores 2 sled::Tree instead of a single sled::Db,
/// stems from the fact that almost all of the functions trees needs to be open which wastes some perfomance
/// passing trees from the struct deletes the need of constant opening of the trees which increase
/// performance
